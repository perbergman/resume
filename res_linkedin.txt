Generative Architect — AI • Cloud • Blockchain • Distributed Systems | Senior Manager, EY


ABOUT

I’m a Generative Architect with 30+ years designing and delivering complex distributed systems across AI, blockchain, and cloud. I work at the intersection of architecture, creativity, and rapid prototyping — turning ambiguity into clean, functioning systems.

I build fast: more than 80 generative prototypes in 2025, and 100+ GitHub repos spanning AI workflows, distributed systems, blockchain tooling, and zero-to-one product experiments. This is the core of my practice: transforming conceptual insight into working software with unusual speed and clarity.

My background runs across telecom systems in Sweden, enterprise cloud platforms, decentralized ledgers, zero-knowledge proofs, digital identity, carbon market infrastructure, and now agentic AI architectures. The through-line is always the same:
seeing structure in noise and making systems that hold up at scale.

I’m deeply fluent in AI-assisted development (Claude Code, Cursor, Windsurf, Copilot, Augment) and I design architectures that combine ledger systems, cloud-native services, workflow engines, smart contracts, event-driven patterns, and large-scale data flows.

I operate best in high-ambiguity, high-complexity environments where rapid understanding, precise architecture, and clean execution matter.
