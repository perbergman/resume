### SUMMARY
Generative Architect with 30+ years designing and delivering complex distributed systems across AI, blockchain, and cloud. Known for extremely fast generative prototyping (**80+ apps in 2025**), deep architectural clarity, and the ability to synthesize multiple domains into elegant, working systems.

Creator with **100+ GitHub repositories** built through a long-term generative engineering practice — spanning AI workflows, distributed systems, blockchain tooling, and rapid 0→1 prototypes.

Operates best in high-ambiguity, high-complexity environments. Expert in AI-assisted development using Claude Code, Cursor, Windsurf, Copilot, and Augment. Designs architectures that integrate ledger systems, cloud-native services, smart contracts, event-driven patterns, and large-scale data flows.

A rare combination of deep systems knowledge, creative intelligence, and rapid 0→1 execution.

---

### VALUE PROPOSITION

I specialize in turning **high-ambiguity, high-stakes technical programs** into **coherent, scalable architectures** that large organizations can actually run. My strength is seeing structure where others see noise — rapidly stabilizing complexity, defining clear patterns, and producing systems that hold together in production at real-world scale.

---

### ARCHITECTURAL THROUGHLINE
Across three decades, my work has followed a single thread:  
**turning complex, ambiguous domains into coherent systems.**

From early telecom and object databases in Sweden → enterprise integration and cloud architectures → decentralized ledgers, identity, and ZKP → to today’s agentic AI and rapid generative prototyping.

Across these eras, one pattern remains constant:  
**seeing structure in noise, moving from insight to architecture quickly, and building systems that hold together under real-world scale.**

This is the core of my practice —  
a blend of engineering depth, pattern recognition, and generative speed that lets new systems emerge fully formed.
